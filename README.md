# co2-temperature-analysis
A data science project analyzing the relationship between CO2 levels and global temperature using Python.

This project explores the relationship between atmospheric CO₂ levels and global temperatures using real-world climate datasets. The goal of this project is to understand whether rising CO₂ concentrations correlate with increases in global temperature. To investigate this, I used two publicly available datasets: monthly CO₂ measurements from the Mauna Loa Observatory and global temperature anomaly data from NOAA. These datasets were cleaned, merged toghether by date, and analyzed using Python to reveal long-term climate trends. After preparing the data, I created visualizations including line graphs showing changes over time and a scatter plot describing the correlation between CO₂ levels and temperatures. The results show a clear upward trend in both the variables and a strong positive correlation, meaning that as CO₂ levels rise, global temperatures tend to rise as well. This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, perform data cleaning and merging, create visualizations using Python, and interpret scientific patterns with data analysis.
